# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I do not know how to print the only name in exercise hashes 2, last question.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? I love taking notes. I understand the material best if I write it down first, then type into the computer.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Deftinitly try to solve the problems by myself. I write down the question, think about it, try to solve it, and if I get stuck, that's when I use Google.
